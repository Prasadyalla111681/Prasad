            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font size="5"><u>Description :</u> </font></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="4">The main aim of our project is to provide information to the parents, that their children have 
                reached the school safely through using a RFID technology. Each student will be equipped with RFID 
                tag along with the school/college ID card.</font></p><p><font size="4">The school/college bus picks up the students from their 
                respective defined bus stops and drops in the school. When the student gets down the bus and tries to 
                enter into the school through the main gate, the RFID reader, fixed to the gate, reads the data from 
                the RFID tag of the student. This information will be passed to the main controlling unit. Thus, the 
                microcontroller reads the input data from the reader and sends a predefined message using GSM to the 
                predefined number along with the time, RTC is used to read the time. </font></p><br><p><font size="4">Another thing in our project is to send the student’s marks whenever the examinations are 
                    conducted. Through using a wireless communication, GSM. At the end of the examinations and when 
                    the results are out, the marks of the students will be sent to their parent’s mobile. Initially, the marks 
                    will be entered student wise marks in the PC which contains Arduino IDE software. Each and every 
                    student’s marks will be sent to the predefined mobile number. The main intention to design this kind 
                    of applications is to put the student’s thoughts and actions into right path. In our project we can control 
                    these two modules by using the one switch according to our need.</font></p>
