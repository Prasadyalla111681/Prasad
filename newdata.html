            <p>
            The effects of poverty on children are wide-reaching and can lead to lifelong struggles, especially when young people don’t receive full educations.<br><br>

                Poverty and education are inextricably linked, because people living in poverty may stop going to school so they can work, which leaves them without literacy and numeracy skills they need to further their careers.<br><br> Their children, in turn, are in a similar situation years later, with little income and few options but to leave school and work.
                
                ChildFund aims to help families escape the cycle of poverty through various educational and livelihood programs. <br>Many times, we learn by listening to communities about their specific needs and working to fulfill them.<br><br>
                
                For example, ChildFund India started a literacy campaign in regions where few households had any books, and because most homes didn’t have electrical power, ChildFund India distributed nearly 40,000 solar-powered lamps so children could read at night time.

        <ol>
            <p>In many countries where ChildFund works, school is free, but there are additional costs for uniforms, books and transportation, especially in rural areas, where a student may travel more than an hour each way by public bus to school. The expenses may be too much for a family to pay, on top of the money the family loses by not sending a child to work or even marrying off a daughter.<br><br>

                Some countries’ governments also spend a lower share of their gross domestic product (GDP) on education, which makes public education less available (particularly to the poor) and of lower quality. Overcrowded classrooms, broken desks, no computers — all are common sights in school districts with budgets that don’t meet students’ needs. Teachers burn out or may be unqualified to teach certain subjects. All of these challenges create a serious disadvantage for children growing up in poor households.

        <ol>
            <p>The importance of education in developing countries cannot be overstated. Education can be the catalyst needed to pull families and communities out of the cycle of poverty. Knowledge gives children the power to dream of a better future and the confidence needed to pursue a full education, which in turn will help generations to come.<br>
        </ol>
    <ol>

                    Education also makes a significant difference for adults, particularly when it applies to day-to-day life, including nutrition, healthcare and gender equity. When adults learn, they become role models to their children, who also wish to learn. </p></ol>

                     <ol>
                         <p>Education in all different forms is key to breaking the cycle of poverty. It has an uplifting effect on other aspects of society that may seem totally unrelated, such as girls’ education lowering the number of prenatal deaths. The relationship between poverty and education is complex, but we know that education helps people make healthier and smarter decisions about their children, their livelihoods and the way they live.</p></ol>
                         <br>
                        <ol>
                     <p>Education also has a significant role in the fight for children’s rights, both in teaching children what they can and should expect from adults, and in showing adults the benefits of respecting their children’s rights. In Timor-Leste, children have stepped forward to advocate for their rights in school through the Children Against Violence project. Touring around the country, they raise awareness of corporal punishment through theatrical drama. In this and many other cases, education is a powerful tool that can make the world a better place.</p></ol>
